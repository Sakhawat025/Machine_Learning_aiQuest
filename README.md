**Regression Analysis in Machine Learning**
**Overview**

This project provides a detailed explanation and implementation of Regression Analysis in machine learning. Regression techniques are used to predict continuous values based on historical data. The project covers various regression methods, their use cases, and Python implementations. You will also find practical examples such as predicting house prices, stock prices, and more.

**Key Concepts**

Regression Analysis: A method to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).

**Types of Regression:**

**Linear Regression:** Predicts a dependent variable using a linear relationship with one or more independent variables.

**Polynomial Regression:** Extends linear regression to model nonlinear relationships.

**Ridge & Lasso Regression:** Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and select important features.

**Logistic Regression:** Used for binary or multi-class classification tasks.

**Loss and Cost Functions:** Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the model's performance.
